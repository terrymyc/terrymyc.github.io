  summary: For many tasks—including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses—scholars, medical doctors, journalists, and policymakers currently screen thousands of texts (e.g., scientific literature, newspapers) by hand to determine relevant texts to include in their review or meta-analysis. The Active learning for Systematic Reviews (ASReview) project, published in [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-020-00287-7), implements machine learning algorithms that interactively query the researcher to accelerate the screening of textual data as efficiently and transparently as possible.

  summary: When using ASReview to screen titles and abstracts in a systematic review, wordclouds can visualize the words that are used the most within the titles and/or abstracts. The package also allows to create wordclouds for the relevant inclusions only. [![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/asreview-wordcloud)](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-wordcloud#installation)

  summary: In an increasing number of survey designs, adaptive data collection strategies for different members of the population are adopted to balance the data quality and cost. Stratifying the target population into subgroups in an effective manner plays a decisive role in identifying the optimal adaptive survey design. This paper presents a stratiﬁcation approach on the basis of which the optimal adaptive survey design can be constructed under the Bayesian analysis to minimize nonresponse bias. This approach stratiﬁes the target population into subgroups based on survey variables of interest predicted by the available auxiliary data such as population registers.
